## Overview

This game offers two exciting levels for you to explore and enjoy. Let's dive into each level:


### Level 1: Single Player Challenge

In the first level, you will engage in a thrilling challenge against the computer. Your objective is to navigate through a series of obstacles by jumping. Be careful not to touch any of the blocks, as doing so will result in losing the game. However, if you manage to avoid touching any blocks and achieve the full score, you will advance to the next round. The level consists of three rounds, with each round progressively increasing in difficulty. If you successfully complete all three rounds, you will unlock the next level.

Level 1 incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript's DOM manipulation to create an immersive gaming experience. The game environment is skillfully rendered using these web technologies, providing interactive gameplay and an appealing visual presentation.


### Level 2: Multiplayer Battle

The excitement continues in the second level, where you can challenge your friends in a thrilling multiplayer battle. This level introduces a competitive environment where two players engage in an arrow-shooting duel. Your goal is to hit your opponent with arrows while skillfully evading their projectiles. The player with the highest score or the last one standing will emerge victorious in each round.

To bring Level 2 to life, HTML canvas is utilized to construct the game environment. While developing this level, I faced various challenges, such as implementing fluid player movements using frames instead of fixed images. However, by leveraging JavaScript's DOM manipulation and CSS, I overcame these obstacles, resulting in improved functionality and visually appealing gameplay.It's important to note that this level is currently incomplete.


## Resources

During the development of this game, I utilized the following resources:

- [Resource 1](https://luizmelo.itch.io/huntress-2) - I used this resource to acquire player animation in the form of a GIF. By incorporating these animated GIFs, the player movement in Level 1 becomes more dynamic and visually appealing.
- [Resource 2](https://ezgif.com/effects) - This resource proved instrumental in editing and enhancing the player GIFs. It allowed me to refine the visuals and ensure a polished appearance for the player animations.
- [Resource 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ) - Understanding HTML canvas and its capabilities was crucial for creating Level 2. This resource provided valuable insights and guidance on utilizing canvas effectively, giving me a solid foundation for implementing the game mechanics.


## Future Updates

I plan to continue improving the second level of the game by addressing the remaining challenges and adding new features. Stay tuned for updates and new releases!
